# Sonar Object Classification Using Neural Networks

## Why Classify Sonar Data: Rock vs. Mine

Underwater sonar data classification, specifically distinguishing between rocks and mines, serves a crucial purpose in various real-world applications. The need for this classification arises from:

### 1. Maritime Security
   - **Mine Detection:** Identifying underwater mines is essential for ensuring safe maritime navigation and protecting naval vessels.

### 2. Environmental Monitoring
   - **Ecological Impact:** Understanding the distribution of rocks and mines helps assess the environmental impact of human activities on the ocean floor.

### 3. Resource Exploration
   - **Underwater Resource Identification:** Classifying objects in sonar data aids in the exploration of underwater resources like minerals and natural deposits.

### 4. Navigation Safety
   - **Safe Navigation:** Accurate classification supports safe navigation for submarines, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and other marine vehicles.

## Neural Network Architecture

In this project, we've implemented a neural network from scratch to perform the classification. The architecture of the neural network comprises:

### 1. Input Layer
   - **Size:** Determined by the features in the sonar data.

### 2. Hidden Layer
   - **Size:** Configurable; in this project, we used a hidden layer size of 24.
   - **Activation Function:** Sigmoid function.

### 3. Output Layer
   - **Size:** 1 (Binary classification - rock or mine).
   - **Activation Function:** Sigmoid function.

### 4. Learning Parameters
   - **Learning Rate:** 0.01
   - **Number of Epochs:** 2000

### 5. Training Process
   - **Forward Propagation:** Calculating the predicted output based on the input features and current weights.
   - **Backward Propagation:** Adjusting weights to minimize the difference between predictions and actual labels.
   - **Epochs:** Iterating through the dataset multiple times for training.

### 6. Model Evaluation
   - **Training Accuracy:** Achieved a training accuracy of [provide accuracy].
   - **Test Accuracy:** Achieved a test accuracy of [provide accuracy].

### 7. Practical Use Cases
   - The trained model can be deployed for real-time sonar data classification, contributing to maritime security and environmental monitoring efforts.

### 8. Future Improvements
   - Future enhancements may involve fine-tuning the neural network parameters, exploring more sophisticated architectures, or incorporating additional features for improved classification accuracy.
